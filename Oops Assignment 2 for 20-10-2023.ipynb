    "#Basic explanation of constructors and their purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Purpose of Constructors: Constructors are used to set up the initial state of an object by initializing its attributes or performing any setup tasks. hey allow you to ensure that an object is in a valid and consistent state from the moment it is created. onstructors provide a way to pass initial values to an object when it is created.\n",

    "#Usage:To define a constructor in Python, you create a special method named __init__ within a class.

    "#A parameterless constructor, also known as a default constructor, is a constructor that takes no arguments (parameters) other than self. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes with default values, typically hard-coded within the constructor. If you don't provide a custom constructor in your class, Python will automatically create a parameterless constructor for you, and it will not require any arguments to instantiate an object. Here's an example of a parameterless constructor:\n",

Its purpose is to allow you to provide specific initial values for the object's attributes when you instantiate an object. You define the parameterized constructor to take the desired arguments and use those arguments to set the object's attributes. \n",

Getter methods allow you to retrieve the value of an attribute, and setter methods enable you to modify the value of an attribute.

It is a way to make these members less accessible from outside the class, while still allowing limited access when necessary. Name mangling alters the name of the member in a way that includes the class name as a prefix, making it less likely to accidentally clash with similarly named members in derived classes or external code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The primary purpose of name mangling is to partially enforce encapsulation by making it more difficult to access private or protected members outside the class. It doesn't make the members completely private, but it acts as a way to prevent unintentional or accidental access to them. Name mangling is essentially a form of \"name scrambling.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Name Mangling Format: When you use a double underscore prefix (e.g., __my_var) for an attribute or method within a class, Python internally renames it by adding the class name as a prefix followed by another underscore (e.g., _ClassName__my_var).\n",
    "\n",
    "#Limited Protection: This renaming is performed automatically by Python, and it is intended to provide limited protection for these members. It makes it less likely that external code or derived classes will accidentally override or access these members.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Encapsulation: Name mangling is not a strict security feature. It doesn't fully prevent access to these members if you explicitly use the mangled name from external code. However, it serves as a signal that the member is intended for internal use, and it should not be accessed directly.\n",

    "#1. Data Hiding:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, which is an object.\n",
    "#Abstraction: By encapsulating data within an object, you hide the internal details of that data from the outside world. This is essential for achieving abstraction because it allows you to expose only the necessary information about an object and hide its implementation details.\n",

    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",

    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
